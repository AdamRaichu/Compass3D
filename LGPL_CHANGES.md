# Changes to the Project

The LGPL license requires that modified projects list the changes made to the original. So, here is a list of the changes I made to the original source code. You can find the complete and exact list of changes (according to GitHub) [here](https://github.com/BVengo/simple-shulker-preview/compare/59f12c389d47c68735d72aa7adbfe99a35ab2f06...AdamRaichu:Compass3D:main).

While this is required, I would like to note that this project is not at all intended to fulfill the same purpose as the project it was forked from. It simply uses the same methods in the Minecraft source code to do so.

- Add the devcontainer file.
- Change the package name to `io.github.adamraichu.Compas3DMod` (all occurences).
- Change license text format to markdown.
- Modify README extensively
- Add `MINECRAFT_COMPASS` `RegexGroup`.
- Extensively modify `Utils`.
- Format code.
- New icon.
- Update `fabric.mod.json` extensively.
- Remove unused config options.
- Replace occurences of shulker or similar words to compass.
- Change all occurences of `MINECRAFT_COMPASS` to `MINECRAFT_LODESTONE_COMPASS`.
- Add `MINECRAFT_COMPASS` to match compasses, not lodestone compasses.
- Remove unused `RegexGroup`s.
- Add changelog.
